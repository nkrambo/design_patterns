## Ternary Expression

In mathematics, a ternary operation is an n-ary operation with n = 3. In computer science, a ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The term springs from words like unary, binary, ternary, etc. Ternary, therefore meaning 3-ary.

The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, ?:, which defines a conditional expression. Often, a simple if-else statement can be used to achieve the same result.

For example:

```javascript
if (fooTrue) {
  bar();
} else {
  fuzz();
}
```

Above code can be shortened with ?:
```javascript
fooTrue ? bar() : fuzz();
```

In JavaScript, conditional operators can be evaluated to an Expression, not just statement.
```javascript
// assigned to a variable
const isFoo = fooTrue ? "yes" : "no";

// passed as an argument in a function
getFoo(fooTrue ? "yes" : "no");
```
